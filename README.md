# FBTimer
A lightweight timer script for FBNeo to make recording scores and running caravan events easier. By default, it will run a five minute timer when the user presses start, to synchronize the beginning of their play with the timer. Alternatively, the timer can be started by loading a user-created savestate, so events are no longer bound to starting from the beginning of every game.

# How To Use
Store it anywhere (FBNeo defaults to %PATH/support/lua, fcadefbneo does not) and run as you would any other lua script in FBNeo or Fightcade FBNeo. Instructions for the various hotkeys are displayed on startup. Savestates saved by the script are stored in the same directory as the lua script.
