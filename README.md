# FBTimer
A lightweight timer script for FBNeo to make recording scores and running caravan events easier.

# How To Use
Store it anywhere (FBNeo defaults to %PATH/support/lua, fcadefbneo does not) and run as you would any other lua script in FBNeo or Fightcade FBNeo. Instructions for the various hotkeys are displayed on startup.
